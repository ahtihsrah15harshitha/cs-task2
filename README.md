🚨 Phishing Email Analysis: Expense Fraud Investigation
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a phishing email disguised as an internal "Expense Fraud Investigation" from a fake HR department. The purpose of this project is to raise awareness and demonstrate how to identify common phishing indicators.

📄 Project Overview
The email under analysis claims to be from Human Resources, warning the recipient about suspicious expenses. However, it includes several red flags that are consistent with phishing attempts.

🔍 Key Phishing Indicators Identified
Suspicious sender domain: Unofficial and misleading email address (alerting-services[.]com).

Deceptive link: Hyperlinked text attempting to redirect the user.

Urgent language: Pressure tactics to force user action.

Lack of branding: Absence of company logos or official formatting.

False sense of security: Mentions a "secure link" to gain trust.

Generic greeting: Uses a name without personalization or formal ID verification.
